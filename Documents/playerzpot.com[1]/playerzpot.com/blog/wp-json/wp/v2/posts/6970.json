Similarly, Fantasy cricket just like the sport has taken the centre stage in the country and boy it&#8217;s a raging fever that has got hold of every passionate cricket lover in building their own fantasy team. Fantasy cricket is basically building a team of players who will then perform in a real match to earn you points.<\/p>\n<p>Although it\u2019s been a while now since fantasy cricket broke through still there have been questions and not enough clarity on how to create a team that is good enough to perform and earn you cash rewards and prizes. Of which the most basic one&#8217;s how to make your fantasy cricket team from scratch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to make your fantasy cricket team?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You need to have a minimum of 3 batters, 3 bowlers, 1 all-rounder and 1 wicket-keeper. You also need to assign the captaincy roles, based on your knowledge and experience you can choose from the selection of players you wish to have on your team. Thus after successfully selecting your squad, you will have to submit the team and then await the real-match results to see where you fair-off. However, this is just the basic understanding of how to make your team, there are other factors you need to consider before making your team. Some of the important ones are listed below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You need to have a plan in place<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Only by fielding the star players won\u2019t see you win maximum points in fantasy cricket. It is more about getting a balanced team that will ensure your team points at all front be it batting, fielding and bowling. So, it&#8217;s better to have knowledge about the players you are picking, their recent form along with their strengths and weaknesses, only then you will be able to field a team that is good enough to compete.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Choose your captains wisely<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We need not emphasize any more on how important the role of a captain and a vice-captain is in the fantasy cricket team. Captain gets your 2x bonus points while the vice-captain adds 1.5x bonus points. This in short is the most strategic way of collecting a maximum number of points provided your pick of captains performed well in the match. Captains should be purely selected on the basis of recent performance and not the basis of status.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fantasy sports is not a game of emotions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fantasy sports is a statistical game, it simply more the points you earn higher are your chances of winning a big cash reward. Of course, everyone has their heart attached to their favourite players and team but fantasy cricket has no room for that, if you know that a player from a certain rival team which is playing is at the peak of his performance get him in as at the end of the day that particular player will get you points. If you are too passionate about your team and your favourite players then perhaps fantasy cricket is not for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Read fantasy cricket blogs before making your team<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not everyone has enough time and energy to do research and then put a team together. For that very purpose, there are different blogs made available with the best of team selection. One may make minor tweaks regarding their preferences and choices in fielding their best possible X1 for the upcoming matches. With a quick read and glance of such blogs and articles, you have all the necessary information you need to know in building your fantasy cricket team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite all the above-mentioned factors one thing that will separate you from the rest is practice and dedication.
