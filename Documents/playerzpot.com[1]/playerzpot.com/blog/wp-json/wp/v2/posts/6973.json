With the recent upheaval of Indian cricket, the sport has gained even more popularity among the masses of the country. The advent of cricketing superstars such as Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in the past ten years have played a major role in boosting the popularity of this sport. With cricket played across the year by several different teams from all over the world, its scope as a fantasy sport has raised tremendously.<\/p>\n<p>Fantasy cricket is one of the most played fantasy games across the sporting kingdom. With more and more cricket matches taking place across the globe, the opportunity to earn money has increased a lot. Nowadays, people have started playing fantasy cricket not just because cricket is their passion, but also because they get to earn a little bit of money on the side with the help of their cricketing knowledge. People have started participating in more and more <a href=\"https:\/\/playerzpot.com\/fantasy-sports\/fantasy-cricket\">fantasy cricket leagues<\/a> with the aim to earn more and more money.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, not everyone is efficient while playing fantasy cricket online and need to take some help and read some tips to help them make money while playing it. Here are a few of those tips and tricks that you can use while playing fantasy cricket and earning money while doing so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cricketing knowledge<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind is knowledge. Yes, it is not compulsory to be a cricket buff and have entire knowledge of the cricketing world. But, having a little bit of knowledge will take you a lot further than the competition. The know-how of which player is in form and which player is a definite starter in the playing XI is important. The other thing that you can always do is ask someone for help. Catch a person with acute knowledge of the game and that will do wonders for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Top researching skills<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The second thing to keep in mind is research. This probably is the most important thing while playing fantasy cricket online. Without proper research, even the most knowledgeable of fans fail to strike when it matters the most. There are several podcasts, articles, chat forums, and videos that discuss the probable lineup and provide helpful tips which in turn help your chances of winning some cash. Remember this; an expert is called an expert because he has good knowledge of the subject as well as the fantasy sport.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An all-rounder team<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having a team of all-rounders in the team is your best shot at getting the most amount of points from a game. Suppose that is an all-rounder fails with the bat, he still has a chance of performing well with the ball considering their all-around ability. A batsman who can bowl well is your best bet at scoring some vital points. This is a trick that many fantasy players fail to make proper use of.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Start small, go big<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Choosing the correct tournament to play is also very important. The correct tournament will ensure that the prize money you win is good enough and that there is a lower factor of risk involved with your money. Joining a small tournament at the beginning is the correct way to go and a risk-free venture. Your chances of winning may be low but you will get a very good hands-on experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep an eye on past and ongoing matches<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once you register on a platform, you should take a look at the past trends and real-time matches and pick the team accordingly. Watching and picking the team in real-time will give you a very big edge over the competition. If you don\u2019t get success in one try, there\u2019s no need to get worried. You can try as many combinations as you can to get the perfect result.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Carefully choosing your captain and vice-captain<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The other things to keep in mind are whom you chose as the captain and vice-captain. The safest bet is to always keep the most in-form player as your captain. The player will surely give you the most amount of points in the long run. While the captain gives your 2x points, the vice-captain provides 1.5x points. So, it is important to choose a good vice-captain for your team as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Taking the leap with a dark horse<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the other option to take a wild guess and go with the dark horse. Although, the surety of points may be less, if the player strikes then you may strike gold as well. The amount of points you may get if your dark horse strikes gold is tremendous. And although it may be a shot in the dark, there are also chances of predicting who can be your dark horse. Some in-depth study of the game and the players will make you adept at guessing the possibility of the dark horse.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Favourable or unfavourable pitch and weather conditions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pitch and weather conditions are also a few factors to be kept in mind while deciding the team. The condition of the pitch is also important to know when you want to select a player as the pitch differs according to the stadium and the weather conditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep in mind the format of the game while playing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The points system may also vary according to the type of match being played whether it is an ODI match, a T20I match, or a Test match. Choose the players according to the format and their fluency with it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_6973\" class=\"pvc_stats total_only  \" data-element-id=\"6973\" style=\"\"><i class=\"pvc-stats-icon medium\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" version=\"1.0\" viewBox=\"0 0 502 315\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"><g transform=\"translate(0,332) scale(0.1,-0.1)\" fill=\"\" stroke=\"none\"><path d=\"M2394 3279 l-29 -30 -3 -207 c-2 -182 0 -211 15 -242 39 -76 157 -76 196 0 15 31 17 60 15 243 l-3 209 -33 29 c-26 23 -41 29 -80 29 -41 0 -53 -5 -78 -31z\"\/><path d=\"M3085 3251 c-45 -19 -58 -50 -96 -229 -47 -217 -49 -260 -13 -295 52 -53 146 -42 177 20 16 31 87 366 87 410 0 70 -86 122 -155 94z\"\/><path d=\"M1751 3234 c-13 -9 -29 -31 -37 -50 -12 -29 -10 -49 21 -204 19 -94 39 -189 45 -210 14 -50 54 -80 110 -80 34 0 48 6 76 34 21 21 34 44 34 59 0 14 -18 113 -40 219 -37 178 -43 195 -70 221 -36 32 -101 37 -139 11z\"\/><path d=\"M1163 3073 c-36 -7 -73 -59 -73 -102 0 -56 133 -378 171 -413 34 -32 83 -37 129 -13 70 36 67 87 -16 290 -86 209 -89 214 -129 231 -35 14 -42 15 -82 7z\"\/><path d=\"M3689 3066 c-15 -9 -33 -30 -42 -48 -48 -103 -147 -355 -147 -375 0 -98 131 -148 192 -74 13 15 57 108 97 206 80 196 84 226 37 273 -30 30 -99 39 -137 18z\"\/><path d=\"M583 2784 c-38 -19 -67 -74 -58 -113 9 -42 211 -354 242 -373 16 -10 45 -18 66 -18 51 0 107 52 107 100 0 39 -1 41 -124 234 -80 126 -108 162 -133 173 -41 17 -61 16 -100 -3z\"\/><path d=\"M4250 2784 c-14 -9 -74 -91 -133 -183 -95 -150 -107 -173 -107 -213 0 -55 33 -94 87 -104 67 -13 90 8 211 198 130 202 137 225 78 284 -27 27 -42 34 -72 34 -22 0 -50 -8 -64 -16z\"\/><path d=\"M2275 2693 c-553 -48 -1095 -270 -1585 -649 -135 -104 -459 -423 -483 -476 -23 -49 -22 -139 2 -186 73 -142 361 -457 571 -626 285 -228 642 -407 990 -497 242 -63 336 -73 660 -74 310 0 370 5 595 52 535 111 1045 392 1455 803 122 121 250 273 275 326 19 41 19 137 0 174 -41 79 -309 363 -465 492 -447 370 -946 591 -1479 653 -113 14 -422 18 -536 8z m395 -428 c171 -34 330 -124 456 -258 112 -119 167 -219 211 -378 27 -96 24 -300 -5 -401 -72 -255 -236 -447 -474 -557 -132 -62 -201 -76 -368 -76 -167 0 -236 14 -368 76 -213 98 -373 271 -451 485 -162 444 86 934 547 1084 153 49 292 57 452 25z m909 -232 c222 -123 408 -262 593 -441 76 -74 138 -139 138 -144 0 -16 -233 -242 -330 -319 -155 -123 -309 -223 -461 -299 l-81 -41 32 46 c18 26 49 83 70 128 143 306 141 649 -6 957 -25 52 -61 116 -79 142 l-34 47 45 -20 c26 -10 76 -36 113 -56z m-2057 25 c-40 -58 -105 -190 -130 -263 -110 -324 -59 -707 132 -981 25 -35 42 -64 37 -64 -19 0 -241 119 -326 174 -188 122 -406 314 -532 468 l-58 71 108 103 c185 178 428 349 672 473 66 33 121 60 123 61 2 0 -10 -19 -26 -42z\"\/><path d=\"M2375 1950 c-198 -44 -350 -190 -395 -379 -18 -76 -8 -221 19 -290 114 -284 457 -406 731 -260 98 52 188 154 231 260 27 69 37 214 19 290 -38 163 -166 304 -326 360 -67 23 -215 33 -279 19z\"\/><\/g><\/svg><\/i> <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Loading\" src=\"https:\/\/playerzpot.com\/blog\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader-2x.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is no doubt whatsoever that cricket is the most followed game in India.
