The existence of PlayerzPot and such apps has made it easier to play <a href=\"https:\/\/playerzpot.com\/playerzpot-app-download\">fantasy football<\/a>. A fantasy team\u2019s creation requires some knowledge and deductive reasoning skills so that you can make the best possible decisions for the upcoming game of fantasy football.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple things that affect the decisions that go into making a team but the basic things are as follows :<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You need to pick eleven players<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, this is something easier said than done, picking eleven players is actually all that fantasy is about. We need to have a combination that has at least three (max five) defenders and midfielders each while at least one (max three) forward is required. There should be a total of eleven players with this combination. The most common selection is 3,4,3 with one goalkeeper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your team can not have more than seven players of the same team, you must pick a good combination of players from both the available teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to understand why and which player we pick as we proceed to select our eleven players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>There should be a reason to pick each player<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The player should be able to contribute to the overall success of their team in terms of time, goals, passes and performance. A clean defensive player also earns clean sheet points and goalkeepers earn save points as well. So, the more shots they save, the better for your team. And the forwards as well as midfielders must possess goal scoring threat to earn maximum points for your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Past performances<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must definitely check the recent performances of the player that you are going to select for your team because it is important to see whether they have been in form or not and how are his team mates showing chemistry on the field with him. These things matter in fantasy football as much as they do in real life games on the pitch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player\u2019s form decides whether or not they have the confidence to keep scoring or open the scoring for your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Goalkeepers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A goalkeeper\u2019s main job is to save their team from conceding goals. They try to stop all the shots that come their way and prevent that from entering the goal. The more saves they make, the better score you have. But it is also true that one goal they concede may cost you heavily. So, selecting a goalkeeper is something that you should not take lightly, they will give you an upper hand if you make the right selection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Defenders<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The defenders to pick are generally those who can help in scoring or score a few goals themselves while also managing to keep a clean sheet for their own team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is always advised to go for the full backs or wing backs due to their crossing abilities and the tendencies to run forwards but on the other hand, center backs also have huge goal scoring potential on deal ball set pieces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all comes down to your research and knowledge about the playing styles of the team and the capability of the player you have selected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Midfielders<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mid guy\u2019s main job is to assist both forward and the defensive line of the team whenever the team needs them to. They also have a higher goal scoring potential than most defenders and therefore you should look to pick some of the team\u2019s penalty, free kick or corner takers if they are in the midfielders category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also complete a huge number of passes in a game for which you could be rewarded well with a lot of points in return on your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fantasy football team<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Forward<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A forward has to be the person you absolutely believe will score a goal for his team or make an assist for one of his team mates. He is the go to man for most of the goal scoring chance creations and they have a decent amount of passing present too. Forwards are less likely to earn any warning cards and generally have lesser fouling roles than their other team departments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is wise to invest well in your forward line as they could win you the big rewards you are looking for in fantasy football.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Overall<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you are done with your selection, it comes down to selecting your captain and vice captains for the team. The rule is simple for both of them<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Captain <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">band will make your team get twice the points that player earns during the game. You should always captain the person who is most likely to be the standout player of the game.<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Vice captain <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">band will make your team get one and a half times the points of that particular player from his match performance. This player should be your second most favoured player for that fixture.<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you are done with these selections, you are ready to field your fantasy football team against your rivals and get ready to watch the thrilling match. The results will come out on your PlayerzPot app screen after the match and you can compare them with your friends and win huge rewards too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, it takes a lot of skill to make a successful fantasy football team and if you have done it then you should feel proud that you were smart enough to understand the rules and make a team that abides by them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_6979\" class=\"pvc_stats total_only  \" data-element-id=\"6979\" style=\"\"><i class=\"pvc-stats-icon medium\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" version=\"1.0\" viewBox=\"0 0 502 315\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"><g transform=\"translate(0,332) scale(0.1,-0.1)\" fill=\"\" stroke=\"none\"><path d=\"M2394 3279 l-29 -30 -3 -207 c-2 -182 0 -211 15 -242 39 -76 157 -76 196 0 15 31 17 60 15 243 l-3 209 -33 29 c-26 23 -41 29 -80 29 -41 0 -53 -5 -78 -31z\"\/><path d=\"M3085 3251 c-45 -19 -58 -50 -96 -229 -47 -217 -49 -260 -13 -295 52 -53 146 -42 177 20 16 31 87 366 87 410 0 70 -86 122 -155 94z\"\/><path d=\"M1751 3234 c-13 -9 -29 -31 -37 -50 -12 -29 -10 -49 21 -204 19 -94 39 -189 45 -210 14 -50 54 -80 110 -80 34 0 48 6 76 34 21 21 34 44 34 59 0 14 -18 113 -40 219 -37 178 -43 195 -70 221 -36 32 -101 37 -139 11z\"\/><path d=\"M1163 3073 c-36 -7 -73 -59 -73 -102 0 -56 133 -378 171 -413 34 -32 83 -37 129 -13 70 36 67 87 -16 290 -86 209 -89 214 -129 231 -35 14 -42 15 -82 7z\"\/><path d=\"M3689 3066 c-15 -9 -33 -30 -42 -48 -48 -103 -147 -355 -147 -375 0 -98 131 -148 192 -74 13 15 57 108 97 206 80 196 84 226 37 273 -30 30 -99 39 -137 18z\"\/><path d=\"M583 2784 c-38 -19 -67 -74 -58 -113 9 -42 211 -354 242 -373 16 -10 45 -18 66 -18 51 0 107 52 107 100 0 39 -1 41 -124 234 -80 126 -108 162 -133 173 -41 17 -61 16 -100 -3z\"\/><path d=\"M4250 2784 c-14 -9 -74 -91 -133 -183 -95 -150 -107 -173 -107 -213 0 -55 33 -94 87 -104 67 -13 90 8 211 198 130 202 137 225 78 284 -27 27 -42 34 -72 34 -22 0 -50 -8 -64 -16z\"\/><path d=\"M2275 2693 c-553 -48 -1095 -270 -1585 -649 -135 -104 -459 -423 -483 -476 -23 -49 -22 -139 2 -186 73 -142 361 -457 571 -626 285 -228 642 -407 990 -497 242 -63 336 -73 660 -74 310 0 370 5 595 52 535 111 1045 392 1455 803 122 121 250 273 275 326 19 41 19 137 0 174 -41 79 -309 363 -465 492 -447 370 -946 591 -1479 653 -113 14 -422 18 -536 8z m395 -428 c171 -34 330 -124 456 -258 112 -119 167 -219 211 -378 27 -96 24 -300 -5 -401 -72 -255 -236 -447 -474 -557 -132 -62 -201 -76 -368 -76 -167 0 -236 14 -368 76 -213 98 -373 271 -451 485 -162 444 86 934 547 1084 153 49 292 57 452 25z m909 -232 c222 -123 408 -262 593 -441 76 -74 138 -139 138 -144 0 -16 -233 -242 -330 -319 -155 -123 -309 -223 -461 -299 l-81 -41 32 46 c18 26 49 83 70 128 143 306 141 649 -6 957 -25 52 -61 116 -79 142 l-34 47 45 -20 c26 -10 76 -36 113 -56z m-2057 25 c-40 -58 -105 -190 -130 -263 -110 -324 -59 -707 132 -981 25 -35 42 -64 37 -64 -19 0 -241 119 -326 174 -188 122 -406 314 -532 468 l-58 71 108 103 c185 178 428 349 672 473 66 33 121 60 123 61 2 0 -10 -19 -26 -42z\"\/><path d=\"M2375 1950 c-198 -44 -350 -190 -395 -379 -18 -76 -8 -221 19 -290 114 -284 457 -406 731 -260 98 52 188 154 231 260 27 69 37 214 19 290 -38 163 -166 304 -326 360 -67 23 -215 33 -279 19z\"\/><\/g><\/svg><\/i> <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Loading\" src=\"https:\/\/playerzpot.com\/blog\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader-2x.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fantasy football is on every football fan\u2019s mind in one way or another ever since it has been invented.
