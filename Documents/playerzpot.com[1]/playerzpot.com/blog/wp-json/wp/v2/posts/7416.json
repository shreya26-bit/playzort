There was no better way to spend your time than playing board games with your friends and close ones. Not only do they keep you entertained but has a sense of inclusiveness and profundity about them which hardly any other games have. All you needed a simple board mechanics, some coins, and dice to play your games.<\/p>\n<p>Boredom is a common disease that infects each and evet human being out there but fortunately, we have got the right solution to get out of this void. Board games are indeed the best to kill the boring time that often makes our day miserable and unhappening. But what are the best board games one can play especially when now you have got the option of online gaming, there can be total confusion, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Well, we have got you covered. These are the games you should play when you are bored.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Carrom:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Carrom is a board game where a total of 2-4 players can play at a time. The game involved two coloured coins and a striker which is used to strike the coins on the board. The aim is to pocket these coins in the four holes made on the corners of the board. The game has popular variations like Total point, Family point, Duboo, Tokyu-ban, and Professional carrom. What is so special about this game is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat and has a lot of twists and turns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ludo:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When talking about board games you\u2019ve got to talk about ludo. I mean there\u2019s no other game designed in a simplistic manner yet leaving an ever-lasting effect on us. Moreover, the game does teach you a lot in general about patience, planning, strategies, and making the most of your opportunities. It\u2019s a cat and a mouse game at times with role reversals, once you are hunting and then the next you are the hunted. It is truly a gem of a game that will and always remain a fan favoruite in the board game world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Snake and Ladders:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Snakes and Ladders is another classic that has etched itself on your memory for a lifetime. The game is simple, reach the finish marker through the 100 boxes without getting bitten by the snakes. Well, anxiety is real when you play this one but surely gives the game a more thrilling dynamic, here you are competing against your friends and at the same time dealing with the threats on hand. It\u2019s just chaos of the best kind which you would more of it every time you play.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Business:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you ever want to feel accomplished then Business is the game made for you. This again is a simple yet interactive board game where you have a limited budget, buy assets, and charge other players when they land upon it. This was indeed a tricky one as you are spoiled for choices across the board and this is what makes the game rather more interesting to play. There are different versions of the game where it can be city-specific or area specific which adds more flavour to the overall fun.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chess:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not a whole bunch of the crowd enjoys this particular game, and the reasons are justified as well. True this is not the board game that everyone prefers to play but there are players who are fascinated and hooked to this one. Chess requires you to function at the highest level of the brain, here you have to predict, plot, and execute to win. The pawns, King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, and Rooks are the pieces on the board, using their special abilities and pathways the players need to outplay and kill the opposition pieces. This is the best of the brain games on this list and therefore worthy of mention.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_7416\" class=\"pvc_stats total_only  \" data-element-id=\"7416\" style=\"\"><i class=\"pvc-stats-icon medium\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" version=\"1.0\" viewBox=\"0 0 502 315\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"><g transform=\"translate(0,332) scale(0.1,-0.1)\" fill=\"\" stroke=\"none\"><path d=\"M2394 3279 l-29 -30 -3 -207 c-2 -182 0 -211 15 -242 39 -76 157 -76 196 0 15 31 17 60 15 243 l-3 209 -33 29 c-26 23 -41 29 -80 29 -41 0 -53 -5 -78 -31z\"\/><path d=\"M3085 3251 c-45 -19 -58 -50 -96 -229 -47 -217 -49 -260 -13 -295 52 -53 146 -42 177 20 16 31 87 366 87 410 0 70 -86 122 -155 94z\"\/><path d=\"M1751 3234 c-13 -9 -29 -31 -37 -50 -12 -29 -10 -49 21 -204 19 -94 39 -189 45 -210 14 -50 54 -80 110 -80 34 0 48 6 76 34 21 21 34 44 34 59 0 14 -18 113 -40 219 -37 178 -43 195 -70 221 -36 32 -101 37 -139 11z\"\/><path d=\"M1163 3073 c-36 -7 -73 -59 -73 -102 0 -56 133 -378 171 -413 34 -32 83 -37 129 -13 70 36 67 87 -16 290 -86 209 -89 214 -129 231 -35 14 -42 15 -82 7z\"\/><path d=\"M3689 3066 c-15 -9 -33 -30 -42 -48 -48 -103 -147 -355 -147 -375 0 -98 131 -148 192 -74 13 15 57 108 97 206 80 196 84 226 37 273 -30 30 -99 39 -137 18z\"\/><path d=\"M583 2784 c-38 -19 -67 -74 -58 -113 9 -42 211 -354 242 -373 16 -10 45 -18 66 -18 51 0 107 52 107 100 0 39 -1 41 -124 234 -80 126 -108 162 -133 173 -41 17 -61 16 -100 -3z\"\/><path d=\"M4250 2784 c-14 -9 -74 -91 -133 -183 -95 -150 -107 -173 -107 -213 0 -55 33 -94 87 -104 67 -13 90 8 211 198 130 202 137 225 78 284 -27 27 -42 34 -72 34 -22 0 -50 -8 -64 -16z\"\/><path d=\"M2275 2693 c-553 -48 -1095 -270 -1585 -649 -135 -104 -459 -423 -483 -476 -23 -49 -22 -139 2 -186 73 -142 361 -457 571 -626 285 -228 642 -407 990 -497 242 -63 336 -73 660 -74 310 0 370 5 595 52 535 111 1045 392 1455 803 122 121 250 273 275 326 19 41 19 137 0 174 -41 79 -309 363 -465 492 -447 370 -946 591 -1479 653 -113 14 -422 18 -536 8z m395 -428 c171 -34 330 -124 456 -258 112 -119 167 -219 211 -378 27 -96 24 -300 -5 -401 -72 -255 -236 -447 -474 -557 -132 -62 -201 -76 -368 -76 -167 0 -236 14 -368 76 -213 98 -373 271 -451 485 -162 444 86 934 547 1084 153 49 292 57 452 25z m909 -232 c222 -123 408 -262 593 -441 76 -74 138 -139 138 -144 0 -16 -233 -242 -330 -319 -155 -123 -309 -223 -461 -299 l-81 -41 32 46 c18 26 49 83 70 128 143 306 141 649 -6 957 -25 52 -61 116 -79 142 l-34 47 45 -20 c26 -10 76 -36 113 -56z m-2057 25 c-40 -58 -105 -190 -130 -263 -110 -324 -59 -707 132 -981 25 -35 42 -64 37 -64 -19 0 -241 119 -326 174 -188 122 -406 314 -532 468 l-58 71 108 103 c185 178 428 349 672 473 66 33 121 60 123 61 2 0 -10 -19 -26 -42z\"\/><path d=\"M2375 1950 c-198 -44 -350 -190 -395 -379 -18 -76 -8 -221 19 -290 114 -284 457 -406 731 -260 98 52 188 154 231 260 27 69 37 214 19 290 -38 163 -166 304 -326 360 -67 23 -215 33 -279 19z\"\/><\/g><\/svg><\/i> <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Loading\" src=\"https:\/\/playerzpot.com\/blog\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader-2x.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Board games have been a means of entertainment and joy for a long period of time.
