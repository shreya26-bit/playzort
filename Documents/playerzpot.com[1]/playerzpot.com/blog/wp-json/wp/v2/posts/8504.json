The tournament witnessed constant interruption of matches due to heavy rains and some games were either washed out, postponed, or had their overs reduced with the DLS method. Nonetheless, the recently concluded edition of the Asian Champion League provided fans with exhilaration and thrill despite marked by challenges of frequent interruption of heavy showers. The six teams across Asia displayed their brilliance, making it a spectacle for passionate cricket enthusiasts around the world.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asian Champion League saw the best moments, including the comeback performance, bowling brilliance, centuries, record-breaking partnerships, big upsets, stunning catches, and thrilling finishes. Here we have got you covered some of the moments from the tournament.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the best moments from the Asian Champion League 2023:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. M Siraj\u2019s Fiery Spell:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>M Siraj grabbed the limelight with his excellent bowling performance against Sri Lanka in the final of the Asian Champion League. He registered his best bowling figures of 6\/21 in his ODI career. He also equalled former Sri Lanka pacer C Vaas&#8217;s record for the fastest five-wicket haul in the history of the Asian Champion League, reaching the milestone in just 16 balls. M. Siraj dismantled Sri Lanka\u2019s batting line-up by scalping four wickets in a single and reduced the opposition\u2019s total to 12\/5 in 4 overs. The 29-year-old was troubling the Sri Lankan batsmen with his swing bowling. M Siraj ended his campaign as the second-highest wicket-taker of the tournament with 10 wickets, including a five-wicket, at an average of 12.20 and an economy rate of 4.63 in five matches.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. KL Rahul\u2019s Comeback Century:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KL Rahul made headlines when he scored a brilliant century in his comeback match against Pakistan in the Super 4 of the Asian Champion League 2023. The 31-year-old scored an unbeaten 111 off 106 balls and forged a 233-run partnership with V Kohli (122* off 94) to help India post a solid total of 356\/2 on the board. KL Rahul returned to action after being sidelined for four months due to injury. He missed the Group Stage of the tournament due to niggle. Rahul\u2019s inclusion in the Asia Cup squad was questioned but team management backed him to make his return to competitive cricket in the Asian Champion League. KL Rahul was roped in as a middle-order batter and amassed 169 runs, including a century, at an average of 84.50 in the tournament.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. The Rise of D Wellalage<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>D Wellalage captured the attention of the cricketing world with his brilliant bowling in the Asian Champion League 2023. The 20-year-old shot into the limelight when rattled India\u2019s batting line-up with his spin bowling and scalped five wickets while conceding 40 runs at an economy rate of 4.00 in 10 overs. He also contributed with the bat, scoring 42 off 46 balls, but his gritty effort went in vain as India lost to Sri Lanka. D Wellalage\u2019s talent was noticed by the cricketing world. He is considered a future star of Sri Lanka cricket. Wellalage made his international debut for Sri Lanka in an ODI against Pakistan in July last year. Till now, the bowling all-rounder has played only ODI, taking 14 wickets from 8 matches.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. R Sharma\u2019s 10,000 Runs Milestone:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian captain R Sharma joined the elite club of batsmen with 10,000 runs in ODI cricket. He achieved this feat during his 53-run knock against Sri Lanka in the Super 4 stage of the Asian Champion League. Sharma became the sixth Indian batsman after S Tendulkar, V Kohli, S Ganguly, R Dravid, and MS Dhoni and the 15th overall to complete 10,000 ODI runs. Also, he surpassed Tendulkar to become the second-fastest player to reach the milestone. Moreover, R Sharma had a decent outing in the Asian Champion League, aggregating 194 runs, including 3 half-centuries, at a strike rate of 107.70 and an average of 48.50 in six matches. Sharma\u2019s overall performance in the tournament was a big positive for India ahead of the ODI World Championship.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Bangladesh\u2019s win against India:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangladesh surprised the cricketing world by defeating India in the last Group 4 stage of the Asian Champion League. Bangladesh pulled off a thrilling 6-run win over Men in Blue to end their campaign on a good note. Though Bangladesh was restricted to 265\/8 by the Indian bowling attack, they managed to bundle out India for 259 despite a century from S Gill. S AL Hassan, M Rahman, and T Sakib were the heroes in Bangladesh\u2019s win against India. This was Bangladesh\u2019s first win against India in 12 years in the Asian Champion League. Moreover, Bangladesh won three of the last four ODIs against India.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. V Kohli and R Sharma 5000-run ODI Partnership&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>V Kohli and R Sharma are not just the best cricketers but also one of the best pairs in ODI cricket. During the match against Sri Lanka, the duo completed a 5000-run partnership in ODIs. They became the third Indian pair and the eighth overall to achieve this milestone. Also, V Kohli and R Sharma were the fastest to score 5,000 partnership runs, achieving in just 86 matches. Additionally, R Sharma accomplished a personal milestone of becoming the first Indian batsman and the second after K Sangakkara to be involved in a 5000-run partnership twice. He had previously achieved this feat with his former opening partner S Dhawan in July 2022. In the same against Sri Lanka, R Sharma completed a 1000-run partnership with S Gill and became the 10th Indian pair to do so in ODIs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. I Ahmed Carnage against Nepal&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I Ahmed was in absolute beast mode against Nepal in the opening match of the Asian Champion League. The 33-year-old unleashed his firepower and scored a brilliant unbeaten 109 off 71 balls. Ahmed\u2019s knock consisted of 11 fours and 4 sixes and was scoring at a strike rate of 153.42. He took Nepal took the cleaners with his dominating batting performance. He also forged a 214-run partnership with B Azam (151 off 131 balls) for the 5th wicket to help Pakistan post a solid total of 342\/6 in 50 overs. Overall, Ahmed had a decent campaign in the Asian Champion League, aggregating 179 runs, including a century, at an average of 89.50 in five matches. He also contributed with the ball for Pakistan, taking four wickets at an average of 30.50 and an economy rate of 6.53.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div><p id=\"pvc_stats_8504\" class=\"pvc_stats total_only  \" data-element-id=\"8504\" style=\"\"><i class=\"pvc-stats-icon medium\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" version=\"1.0\" viewBox=\"0 0 502 315\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"><g transform=\"translate(0,332) scale(0.1,-0.1)\" fill=\"\" stroke=\"none\"><path d=\"M2394 3279 l-29 -30 -3 -207 c-2 -182 0 -211 15 -242 39 -76 157 -76 196 0 15 31 17 60 15 243 l-3 209 -33 29 c-26 23 -41 29 -80 29 -41 0 -53 -5 -78 -31z\"\/><path d=\"M3085 3251 c-45 -19 -58 -50 -96 -229 -47 -217 -49 -260 -13 -295 52 -53 146 -42 177 20 16 31 87 366 87 410 0 70 -86 122 -155 94z\"\/><path d=\"M1751 3234 c-13 -9 -29 -31 -37 -50 -12 -29 -10 -49 21 -204 19 -94 39 -189 45 -210 14 -50 54 -80 110 -80 34 0 48 6 76 34 21 21 34 44 34 59 0 14 -18 113 -40 219 -37 178 -43 195 -70 221 -36 32 -101 37 -139 11z\"\/><path d=\"M1163 3073 c-36 -7 -73 -59 -73 -102 0 -56 133 -378 171 -413 34 -32 83 -37 129 -13 70 36 67 87 -16 290 -86 209 -89 214 -129 231 -35 14 -42 15 -82 7z\"\/><path d=\"M3689 3066 c-15 -9 -33 -30 -42 -48 -48 -103 -147 -355 -147 -375 0 -98 131 -148 192 -74 13 15 57 108 97 206 80 196 84 226 37 273 -30 30 -99 39 -137 18z\"\/><path d=\"M583 2784 c-38 -19 -67 -74 -58 -113 9 -42 211 -354 242 -373 16 -10 45 -18 66 -18 51 0 107 52 107 100 0 39 -1 41 -124 234 -80 126 -108 162 -133 173 -41 17 -61 16 -100 -3z\"\/><path d=\"M4250 2784 c-14 -9 -74 -91 -133 -183 -95 -150 -107 -173 -107 -213 0 -55 33 -94 87 -104 67 -13 90 8 211 198 130 202 137 225 78 284 -27 27 -42 34 -72 34 -22 0 -50 -8 -64 -16z\"\/><path d=\"M2275 2693 c-553 -48 -1095 -270 -1585 -649 -135 -104 -459 -423 -483 -476 -23 -49 -22 -139 2 -186 73 -142 361 -457 571 -626 285 -228 642 -407 990 -497 242 -63 336 -73 660 -74 310 0 370 5 595 52 535 111 1045 392 1455 803 122 121 250 273 275 326 19 41 19 137 0 174 -41 79 -309 363 -465 492 -447 370 -946 591 -1479 653 -113 14 -422 18 -536 8z m395 -428 c171 -34 330 -124 456 -258 112 -119 167 -219 211 -378 27 -96 24 -300 -5 -401 -72 -255 -236 -447 -474 -557 -132 -62 -201 -76 -368 -76 -167 0 -236 14 -368 76 -213 98 -373 271 -451 485 -162 444 86 934 547 1084 153 49 292 57 452 25z m909 -232 c222 -123 408 -262 593 -441 76 -74 138 -139 138 -144 0 -16 -233 -242 -330 -319 -155 -123 -309 -223 -461 -299 l-81 -41 32 46 c18 26 49 83 70 128 143 306 141 649 -6 957 -25 52 -61 116 -79 142 l-34 47 45 -20 c26 -10 76 -36 113 -56z m-2057 25 c-40 -58 -105 -190 -130 -263 -110 -324 -59 -707 132 -981 25 -35 42 -64 37 -64 -19 0 -241 119 -326 174 -188 122 -406 314 -532 468 l-58 71 108 103 c185 178 428 349 672 473 66 33 121 60 123 61 2 0 -10 -19 -26 -42z\"\/><path d=\"M2375 1950 c-198 -44 -350 -190 -395 -379 -18 -76 -8 -221 19 -290 114 -284 457 -406 731 -260 98 52 188 154 231 260 27 69 37 214 19 290 -38 163 -166 304 -326 360 -67 23 -215 33 -279 19z\"\/><\/g><\/svg><\/i> <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" alt=\"Loading\" src=\"https:\/\/playerzpot.com\/blog\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader-2x.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p><div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div><div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Asian Champion League ODI 2023 came to an end with India clinching their eighth title by humbling Sri Lanka in the final.
